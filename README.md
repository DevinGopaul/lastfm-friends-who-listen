# Friends Who Listen
You probably noticed the new [Last.fm](http://last.fm) design.
One thing I really miss, the *Friends who listen to XY* widget.

So I wrote a browser extension for that.

It uses the official Last.fm API so it's quite fast, it usually loads until a second. But to save requests, friends are cached for seven days and the concrete play counts for 24 hours.

By *friends* I mean people you follow. I just like the word *friends* more.
