# Friends Who Listen
You probably noticed the new [Last.fm](http://last.fm) design.
One thing I really miss, the *Friends who listen to XY* widget.

So I wrote a browser extension for that.

It uses the official Last.fm API so it's quite fast (it depends on how many friends you have). But to save requests, caching is enabled by default. You can disable it or choose when the cache should expiry in settings (the cog icon).

By *friends* I mean people you follow. I just like the word *friends* more.
